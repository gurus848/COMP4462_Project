Some work on Jupyter notebook
Similar to Guru's work on Task 3 Viz 2 Heatmap

Current Problems/Issues:
1. Problem of map not displaying for the map which does not has the HK part
2. For a top artist, theoritically there can be multiple tracks on the top list, this complicates the results from the code. Proposed solution: 
Count the total number of streams for each artist across all the tracks.
